Q1.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Ans:It is apropriate to create a remote repository to collaborate the project with
the team or community.

Q2.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Ans:It might save the data, i.e, if unauthorized person has access to github repository & 
if he delets all the data in the github repository,if git automatically updates local repo
sitory w.r.t remote repository(here it is git repo),then all the data in the local repo will
aslo be deleted.
