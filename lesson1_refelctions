Q1.How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that 
was introduced
Ans:Instead of viewing through the entire file for changes, diff command directly 
gives us the changes between two versions.

Q2.How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?
Ans: Easy access to history makes user of the team or community to see what 
advancement has been done in the projec,they can also learn what were the features
add & bugs removed from the project, so that they can further devlop the
project

Q3.What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a 
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs 
does?
Ans: Git can be used for version controlling of source codes ,txt files etc.Most of 
the times git is used for version controlling of code ,in which commits must be made 
for a particular logical change or addition to the main code ,so manuall committing is 
more suitable than automatic committing for git.Google docs deal with txt files which 
requires automatic committing to make sure that each and every word add automatically 
saves to the file automatically.
